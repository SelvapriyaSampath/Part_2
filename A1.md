Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/round-health/id1059591124?mt=8**

**DESCRIPTION**
Round Health is the medication reminder iOS app that reminds a user when the medication has to be taken and also reminds the user when the pills are going to be over to get new ones. The user has to add all the medications that are taken by him, its dosage and the time range he needs to take them. The app reminds the user to take the medicine during the given time and the user can mark in the app that he’s taken the medicine. 

**FEATURES**
 	The app has in built list of medicines and the user can select from the drop down.
 	It has dosages list of almost all the medicines in the list.
 	The user can also select the quantity of each medicine that needs to be taken.
 	It also allows to user to set the time range of medicine to be taken and set time in interval time between each reminder.
 	If the user cannot for figure out what medicine is for what illness, he can also add nickname for each medicines.
 	The medicines taken for each day can be viewed in Today tab and there is also a monthly view available.
 	The app can also be connected to Apple watch.
 	It supports family sharing set up and it allows at least 6 members in a family to use this app.

**WHY THIS APPLICATION?**
I found the application very interesting as it had a very simple concept but was executed neatly. Also after using this app for quiet a few days, I feel this app works perfectly without any bugs and it will be very much useful for people who need to take medications on time. 
**BUY-IN FOR THE USER**
This is a free app and there is no need for any kind of registrations to be done. UI design is made very simple and so it is very easy for any user to use this app. For the concept of this app, it will mostly be used by old people who need to take regular medication. It is very much handy for the all the users and also the app has constant upgrades that are being done. The app is going to team up with Alto pharmacists for more sophisticated user experience. 
**TECHNOLOGIES LEVERAGED**
The founder of the app has published an article in Medium website [1] and told that they have used Sketch Mirror tool for designing the layout of the app and FrameJS was used for prototyping UI interactions.  CodePush was used to release the app in beta version and as there were code changes that were being made it was immediately reflected in staging environment of the app. Reactive Native code was used for building this app. 
STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS
Pro – The UI of the app looks very neat and easy to use. The very less and relatively simple steps to be done make the app handier and reminders are great way for one not to forget to take any medications. The reminders are also made in such a way that is not annoying to the user and the user can view them even in Apple watch.
Con – The monthly view that is being shown can be more detailed. Also, few medicines in the list seem to have some spelling errors.

IMPROVEMENTS 
It would be great if the app could  provide a online pharmacy that can view the prescriptions of patients and deliver medicines to the users. Once the medicines are delivered, the app can automatically update the list for users and remind them. 

HEURISTIC EVALUATION 
Match between system and real world
As mentioned early, the app has very simple design and also very simple words has been used everywhere in the app and it makes it very much easy for the user to relate to the app. There were no complex medical terms that were used. For example, the user is able to export the data to see in excel format as follows. Even the data given in this format is easily relatable to the user. 

The concepts like medications, dosages etc that are used by app are very much familiar and straightforward to the user and even if the user is not familiar as for what each medicine is being used they have an option to add nicknames to each medicine and so it will be easy for the user to remember it.
User control and freedom
The user control and freedom in this app can be observed. Even if a choses something else in app by mistake he can easily resolve it. The undo and redo options can also be done easily in this app. For example, if the user unknowingly clicks the “taken” button for a medicine that was not actually been taken, just with one click app provides option to the user  to either change the time of reminding for the medicine or “untake” button is present so that the user can easily click it and undo the changes he has made. 

Application: SPG Keyless
Link: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id312306003

DESCRIPTION
SPG app is specifically designed for Starwood Hotels and Resorts for the Starwood Preferred Guests. The app allows the user to register for the SPG Program and then book room in any Starwood hotel around the world. The Unique Selling Point of the app is one of its features called SPG Keyless. The SPG Keyless allows the user book a hotel and enables mobile check-in where the user does not have to go to front desk before checking in to room. The user can just go directly to his room and check-in using his mobile.
HOW IT WORKS?
 	The app allows the user to be enrolled to SPG Membership. As soon as the user is enrolled the user gets SPG number with which the user can check-in to any Starwood hotel.
 	Once the device from which the booking is been done is registered, the user can book keyless reservations
 	The app provides digital key to the user and it can be viewed in user’s phone along with the room number.  
 	The room key readers are being installed in the hotels and the user can easily check-in to the rooms.
 	If the digital key is not working the user can immediately contact the support and it will be resolved.
 	The app can also be connected to Apple watch 
WHY THIS APPLICATION?
The Mobile Check-In feature in the app is innovative and it interests me. It can easily be used by registering the mobile device and even Multi User Check-in is possible through this feature.
BUY-IN FOR THE USER
Starwood Hotels and Resorts is one of the leading people in this business and they have hotels all around the world. So this app can be downloaded by the users from all around the world. Also, the app allows the user to easily register for Starwood Preferred Guest program. All types of reservations like Group Reservations, Company Reservations etc., can be made through this app. The app allows user to easily register and unregister the device for keyless reservations.
TECHNOLOGIES LEVERAGED
The Backend processes in the app were developed by Java. Assa Abloy was the vendors for the keyless doors and they used their own technology platform called Seos. API requests are sent according to the actions done by the user. 


STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS
Pros – This application is very innovative and can be handy for the user. Also, the user can save the time of going to front desk for check-in and getting the physical keys.
Cons – The Starwood hotels that offer this technology is very limited around the world. So, if the user needs to make any keyless reservation there are very limited options.
IMPROVEMENTS 
This Mobile Check-In can be installed in more hotels and also UI be made more clean to look at. Personally, as a user I feel the UI looks very congested and it can be made to look more vivid so that it creates user friendliness.

HEURISTIC EVALUATION 
Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
The SPG Application provides clear error messages that are easily understandable to the user. For Example, if any of the personal information provided by the user is not right, it throws an alert telling “There seems to be a problem with the personal info entered. Please make sure you have entered the information in the required sections”. Similarly, there are many such instances in the app that lets the user know about what exactly the error is about and how to resolve it.
Recognition rather than recall
The app is mainly used to make reservations in hotels. So, it mostly deals with room type, rate plan, preferences etc. It has clearly mentioned information of how much to be paid for each room and what amenities are available. It is then displayed in each and every screen and so user does not have to remember or recall any of it. For example, the preferences are displayed in the very first screen and then the user chooses the room and sees the rate, it is all being displayed at last screen right before the user pays for the room so that user does not have to go back and check if information entered are right.
